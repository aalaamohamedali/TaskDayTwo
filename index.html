   <h2>2. What is a Pull Request and Request? Difference between them?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pull Request (PR):
        A pull request is a GitHub feature used to notify others that you want to merge changes (from your branch or fork) into another branch (usually main) in a repository.</li>
    <li>
        Request (in general):
    A request is just a generic term meaning you ask for something. A pull request is a type of request.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul> âœ… Difference:
    <li>
        "Pull Request" is specific to GitHub for merging code.
    </li>
    <li>"Request" can be anything and is more general.

    </li>
  </ul>

<h2>6. What is Git Rebase and how to use it?</h2>

            git checkout feature-branch
            git rebase main

        </pre>
        <pre>
            # Resolve conflicts manually, then:
